# Mywallet
My wallet is an android application build using Android Studio. The purpose of this application is to give
the user the ability to keep track of his/her wallet which means to know the people to who he/she owes money, and the
people that owe them money in return. We have also included the feature to set up the date that will send to the client that
owes money an email reminder before the due date.
